# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Getting Started

### To have a copy of this project running on your local machine, follow these commands:

- Clone this repo to your local machine
  -  `git clone git@github.com:traveler-hub/book-store.git`

  - Run from your termminal, `npm start` to open the project in your browser.

**This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

> As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

- [Text Editor(VScode Recommended)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code in any programming language, without switching editors.

### Setup

**Run from your terminal:**

- `npx create-react-app ./`

**cd into space-traveler-hub folder, then run from your terminal:**

- `npm start`

### Usage

**When the above commands aresuccessfully run, your browser should open on `localhost:3000`, if not, open your browser and load `127.0.0.1:3000` to see your default template loaded**
